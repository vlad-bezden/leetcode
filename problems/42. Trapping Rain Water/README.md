## [42. Trapping Rain Water](https://leetcode.com/problems/trapping-rain-water/)
### Hard

Given n non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of
each bar is 1, compute how much water it can trap after raining.

__Example 1:__

```
Input: height = [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]
Output: 6
```

__Explanation:__
The above elevation map (black section) is represented by array [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]. In this case, 6 units of rain water (blue section) are being trapped.

__Example 2:__

```
Input: height = [4,2,0,3,2,5]
Output: 9
```

__Constraints:__

* n == height.length
* 0 <= n <= 3 * 104
* 0 <= height[i] <= 105
