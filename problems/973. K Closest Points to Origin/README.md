## [973. K Closest Points to Origin](https://leetcode.com/problems/k-closest-points-to-origin/)
### Medium

Given an array of points where `points[i] = [xi, yi]` represents a point on the `X-Y`
plane and an integer `k`, return the `k` closest points to the origin `(0, 0)`.

The distance between two points on the `X-Y` plane is the Euclidean distance (i.e., `âˆš(x1 - x2)2 + (y1 - y2)2`).

You may return the answer in **any order**. The answer is **guaranteed** to be **unique** (except for the order that it is in).


__Example 1:__
```
Input: points = [[1,3],[-2,2]], k = 1
Output: [[-2,2]]
```

_Explanation:_
* The distance between (1, 3) and the origin is sqrt(10).
* The distance between (-2, 2) and the origin is sqrt(8).
* Since sqrt(8) < sqrt(10), (-2, 2) is closer to the origin.
* We only want the closest k = 1 points from the origin, so the answer is just [[-2,2]].

__Example 2:__
```
Input: points = [[3,3],[5,-1],[-2,4]], k = 2
Output: [[3,3],[-2,4]]
```
_Explanation:_
* The answer [[-2,4],[3,3]] would also be accepted.

__Constraints:__
* 1 <= k <= points.length <= 104
* -104 < xi, yi < 104
