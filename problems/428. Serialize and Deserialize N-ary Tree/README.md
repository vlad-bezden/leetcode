## [428. Serialize and Deserialize N-ary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/serialize-and-deserialize-n-ary-tree/)
### Hard

Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into a sequence of bits
so that it can be stored in a file or memory buffer,
or transmitted across a network connection link to be reconstructed later
in the same or another computer environment.

Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize an N-ary tree.
An N-ary tree is a rooted tree in which each node has no more than N children.
There is no restriction on how your serialization/deserialization algorithm should work.
You just need to ensure that an N-ary tree can be serialized to a string and this
string can be deserialized to the original tree structure.

__Constraints:__

* The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 104].
* 0 <= Node.val <= 104
* The height of the n-ary tree is less than or equal to 1000
* Do not use class member/global/static variables to store states. Your encode and decode algorithms should be stateless.
