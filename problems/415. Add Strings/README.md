## [415. Add Strings](https://leetcode.com/problems/add-strings/)
### Easy

Given two non-negative integers, `num1` and `num2` represented as string, return the _sum_ of `num1` and `num2` as a string.

You must solve the problem without using any built-in library for handling large integers (such as BigInteger). You must also not convert the inputs to integers directly.


__Example 1:__
```
Input: num1 = "11", num2 = "123"
Output: "134"
```

__Example 2:__
```
Input: num1 = "456", num2 = "77"
Output: "533"
```

__Example 3:__
```
Input: num1 = "0", num2 = "0"
Output: "0"
```

__Constraints:__
* 1 <= num1.length, num2.length <= 104
* num1 and num2 consist of only digits.
* num1 and num2 don't have any leading zeros except for the zero itself.
